						<p>
							We are super excited to be able to offer our Winter Storage Share again this year! The goal of our winter storage share is to offer you a bulk assortment of <a href="index.php?p=ourCrops" class="colorLink">vegetables fresh from the farm</a> that will keep for many months with very little fuss. Indeed, many of the veggies offered in the share will store well in your cabinet or on your counter for the long months of winter, allowing you to have nourishing, fresh, and local, organic vegetables even when the snow is piled high to your door. For $125, you will receive over 100 lbs of food! 
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="index.php?p=contact" class="colorLink">Pick up</a> will take plce on November 24th, the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, between 10am and 6pm. We have limited number of shares available on a first-come, first-serve basis. You do not have to be a current NBO share member to get a bulk share. If you are interested in storing and eating NBO produce throughout more of the winter, we encourage you to purchase multiple shares.
