						<h3 id="newsletterWinter">Winter Storage Share</h3>
						<img src="images/winterShareImg.jpg">
						<p>  
							For those of you who aren't familiar with it, the winter storage share is a separate one-time bulk pick-up in late November. The goal of the share is to provide you with an assortment of farm veggies that can be stored with little fuss, to keep you going through the first part of the winter. For $125 you receive over 100 lbs of food. 
						</p>
						<p class="noMargin">
							We expect the storage share to include something along these lines (the exact assortment and quantity may vary slightly depending on availability in the fields):
						</p>
						<ul class="ulList">
							<li>10lbs each of carrots, sweet potatoes, potatoes, and onions;</li>
							<li>4 cabbages, 4 butternut, and 4 brussel sprout stalks;</li>
							<li>20 lbs of your choice of assorted vegetables (including more of the above as well as beets, parsnips, turnips, celery root, leeks, radishes, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.);</li>
							<li>5lbs of your choice of mixed cooking greens like kale, collards, chard, etc.;</li>
							<li>2lbs of your choice of mixed salad greens and a few heads of lettuce.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Pick up will take place on November 24, the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, between 10am and 6pm. We have a limited number of shares available on a first-come, first-serve basis, so don't delay! You do not have to be a current NBO share member to get a bulk share. If you are interested in storing and eating NBO produce throughout more of the winter, we encourage you to purchase multiple shares. 
						</p>
						<p>
							To sign up, please complete this form and return it to us with your payment (we need a full payment to reserve your spot). You're welcome to mail it in or drop it off in the shareroom (we will have more blank forms in the shareroom if you want to pick one up there). Let us know if you have any questions!

						<h3 id="newsletterStorage">How to Store Vegetables</h3>
						<p>
							If you're curious about where you might put 100 lbs of veggies, here is the quick version.
						</p>
						<p>
							Roots (carrots, beets, turnips, celeriac, parsnips, radishes, etc.), and Cabbage  &#8211; like cold, damp, and dark. But they don't want to freeze. 
						</p>
						<p class="noMargin">
							Some places to keep them:
						</p>
							<ul class="ulList">
								<li>Your fridge! Easiest, if you can find the room;</li>
								<li>An unheated portion of your basement, mudrrom, or other cold room in your house;</li>
								<li>A garage with blankets thrown over them to prevent freezing.</li>
							</ul>
						<p>
							Onions and garlic &#8211; like someplace dry, dark, and cool. The light will trigger their innate desire to grow and sprout. Easiest is to keep them in a paper bag in a cupboard down low somewhere in your kitchen (the down low cupboards don’t get as toasty since heat rises).
						</p>
						<p>
							Squash, potatoes, and sweet potatoes like dry, dark and room temperature. In a paper bag in a cupboard or on your countertop is fine (squash doesn't need to be dark... it can be naked on your counter).
						</p>
						<p>
							Greens, Broccoli, and Cauliflower &#8211; these you just need to eat. Or… you can chop, quickly blanch, and freeze them so they last through the winter.
