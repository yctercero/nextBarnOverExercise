# Next Barn Over Farm Site Re-Design (Class assignment, not launched)

As part of a class assignment I had to re-design a site and code it from scratch. I chose to re-design a local farm share's website. This project was done Spring 2016.

This is what the site looked like at the time I was re-designing it - http://bit.ly/2ciXcuT
