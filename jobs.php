				<h3>Apprenticeship</h3>
				<img src="images/jobsImg3.jpg" alt="Photo of staff member smiling.">
				<p>
					We feel that it is just as important to grow good food as it is to help train new farmers.  We strive to teach our apprentices the skills and knowledge that they will need to run their own farm one day.  In return, we expect a great deal of hard work, and commitment. We will try to tailor each apprenticeship contract to the unique needs and learning goals expressed by each apprentice. It is our commitment to help farmers find careers in the field and we will assist in finding future placements and providing ongoing consultation and mentoring.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prospective apprentices should <a href="index.php?p=contact" class="colorLink">contact us</a> between August and February. If it is possible we would like to have you come for a visit and spend a day or two during the prior season (April-October) working with us. Interviews and hiring will be conducted between December and March. Contacts after April are welcome for the following year or short-term positions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Feel free to <a href="index.php?p=contact">contact us</a> with any questions.

				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				<img src="images/jobsImg1.jpg" alt="Photo of staff member working.">
				<p>
					If you have never done farm work before, you should know that it is hard, healthy work.  It requires a lot of steady output of energy at as fast a pace as you are able to maintain.  Your ability to meet such a demand will grow as the season progresses, provided that you stay committed to the effort. We do everything we can to provide a fun, challenging, and loving environment, where such a commitment can be met.  We believe as deeply in fun as we do in hard work. 
				</p>
				<p>
					While prior farm experience can be helpful, the primary qualifications are enthusiasm and dedication to the work, a positive attitude, a strong work ethic, reliability, and an interest in farm systems. An openness and enthusiasm for learning the systems we use, as well as keen observation of what is going on around you will serve you well in this work. A good sense of humor is always helpful. We are constantly shifting tasks, but the ability to perform repetitive work steadily, efficiently, and with a positive attitude is essential. We believe that itâ€™s possible to be both hardworking and easygoing (we like to think we are!). While the work is rewarding and can be fun, it is also very physically demanding. Applicants must be in good physical condition and able to work long hours, outdoors, in any weather.

				<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
				<img src="images/jobsImg2.jpg" alt="Photo of worker out on the farm.">
				<p>
					Education at the farm is very much a hands on experience. Apprentices will learn by doing. We all work side-by-side in the fields with leadership from the <a href="index.php?p=thePeople" class="colorLink">managers</a> and more experienced field crew. There is a wide range of daily tasks throughout the season including (but not limited to): harvesting, hand-weeding, hoeing, transplanting, moving row cover, tractor cultivation, working in the shareroom, washing vegetables, laying irrigation, tractor and truck maintenance, and cleaning. Less frequent tasks include: small construction or carpentry projects, errands, occasional computer projects, and other miscellaneous projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each crew member also takes on specific area(s) of the farm for which they are responsible (for example: u-pick field, washroom, the shop, etc). We welcome and encourage folks to take on more responsibility as they get comfortable and familiar with the operation. 
				</p>
				<p>
					At the start of the year, each apprentice is assigned responsibility for one tractor. They do most of the maintenance on this tractor as well as the cultivation tasks that the tractor performs throughout the year.
