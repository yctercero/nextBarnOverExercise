						<!-- <h3>Our Partnerships</h3> -->
						<p>
							We partner with a number of different local organizations. These partnerships help accomplish our goal - we believe everyone should have access to healthy, local, sustainably-grown food and we envision our farm as part of a greater movement for <a href="index.php?p=farmResources" class="colorLink">food justice</a> and <a href="index.php?p=farmResources" class="colorLink">food sovereignty</a>. We think the CSA model is a great way to provide nourishing food, support local farming, steward the land, and act as a gathering place for vibrant community.
