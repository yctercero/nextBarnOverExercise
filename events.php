					<h4>Shared Harvest &#8211; Coming Together for Food and Justice</h4>
					<p>
						Hear from Gardening the Communityâ€™s youth, staff, and board about their work for food justice and youth leadership in Springfield. Learn about the GTC EATS! Farm Share, a collaboration between GTC and Next Barn Over.
					</p>
					<p>
						To become sustainable over the long term, GTC needs to extend and deepen its network of support. Help us build bridges across the divides of our valley. We hope to see you on September 12th. All money raised will support GTC's work for food justice and youth development in Springfield. Click here to RSVP. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Shared Harvest will be a kid-friendly event, and we invite you to come even if you can't stay for the whole time. Dinner will be an informal buffet, followed by discussion and music. Afterwards, we'll also light a bonfire and roast up some s'mores. Feel free to bring family and friends along with you. RSVPs are appreciated as they help us plan for how much food to cook.
