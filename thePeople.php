						<p>
							The Farm Crew is made up six folks including apprentices and experienced farm hands.  Crew members participate in all aspects of the farm from field preparation to planting to distribution and everything in between. While much of the day to day work is weeding and harvesting, apprentices will have exposure to all of our farm systems and will gain skills in specific areas and with specific pieces of equipment. If you are interested in joining the team, checkout our <a href="index.php?p=jobs" class="colorLink">employment</a> page.

							<h3>Ray Young</h3>
							<p class="boldText">Farmer/Owner</p>
							<p>
								Ray Young started Next Barn Over Farm in 2010. Previously, Ray spent three seasons as an apprentice and manager at the Food Bank Farm in Hadley, and worked as an assistant farm manager at Casey Farm in Rhode Island. Prior to pursuing a path in farming, Ray co-founded and worked with the political theater troupe Liberty Cabbage Theater Revival and on many grassroots community justice projects in Western MA. In 2005, Ray traded in stage life for the glamorous work of crawling through manure. And although it wasnâ€™t the romantic pastoral work imagined, it is, as you might expect, a sticky profession. Ray has been gratefully knee-deep in it ever since.
