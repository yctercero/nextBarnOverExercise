						<h3>What is an on-farm share?</h3>

						<p>
							As a mixed vegetable CSA farm, we grow <a href="index.php?p=ourCrops" class="colorLink">over forty different crops</a> for weekly distribution to our share-members throughout the harvest season, from June through October. Members have the opportunity each week to choose from an abundant variety of fresh, seasonal produce. While the share size increases in volume and diversity as the season progresses, a share typically comprises 1-2 grocery bags and is intended to feed 3-5 people. Included below is a list of the crops that you can expect to find in your share throughout the stages of the season.
						</p>
						<p>
							The share barn is where it all happens. This is where you as a member come once a week to pick out your share. What crops are available and the quantities you receive will be posted on easy to read chalkboards; the farmers will be there if you have any questions. The farm shop is easy to navigate, kid friendly, and a great place to share recipes with other members.

						<p>
							To become a CSA sharemember for the 2015 growing season you can either use our handy <a href="index.php?p=signUp" class="colorLink">online registration</a> form or you can download and fill out the <a href="documents/NextBarnOver-SignUp2015.pdf" target="_blank" class="colorLink">sign-up sheet form</a>. Members can pay up front or choose a payment schedule for their shares. Folks may share a CSA share between two households by either coming together or alternating pick up weeks. We also offer an 'every-other-week' share for members who want a smaller amount of vegetables. Members pick up the same amount and type of vegetables when they come to the farm, but only come every other week. We do accept SNAP/food stamp benefits for farm shares (please contact <a href="mailto:membership@nextbarnover.com" class="colorLink">membership@nextbarnover.com</a> for more info). 
						</p>
						<p>
							Next Barn Over CSA members can also expect to enjoy: a <a href="index.php?p=newsletter" class="colorLink">biweekly newsletter</a> full of recipes, farm news and sustainable agriculture information; opportunities to purchase bulk produce at discount prices for canning and freezing; the opportunity to volunteer on the farm; invitations to <a href="index.php?p=events" class="colorLink">farm events</a> such as potlucks and film screenings; and daily recreational access to the farm for walking, picnicking, and "you-picking".
						</p>
						<p>
							We also offer several locally sourced items for sale in our farmstore including bread, cheese, yogurt, eggs, honey, fruit, and other good things.
